## Why Detecting Cost Anomalies Matters

Cost anomalies in cloud environments can result from:
- Unforeseen spikes in resource usage.

- Unexpected increases in demand due to mismanagement or erroneous code.

Setting up an alert ensures that you receive notifications in case any of these anomalies occur, allowing you to take immediate corrective actions before the costs spiral out of control.
