I configured the basic settings for the VM, including the region, size, and operating system.

## Step 3: Configure Disks and Network
Next, I configured the **disks** and **network** for the VM to ensure proper connectivity.

## Step 4: Review and Create VM
I reviewed the configuration and clicked **Create** to provision the VM.

## Step 5: Connect via SSH
Once the VM was created, I connected to it via SSH to verify everything was set up properly.

## Step 6: Check Cost and Billing
Finally, I checked the **Cost Management** and **Billing** sections to make sure I wasnâ€™t being charged unexpectedly.


## Conclusion
By following these steps, I successfully created and managed a Virtual Machine in Azure. This process was a great hands-on learning experience.
